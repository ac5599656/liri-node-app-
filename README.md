## Summary

Liri Node App is a useful app because users can find info on any movie or song.
The Liri Node App has three functions: movie, spotifyThis, and doWhatItSays.  
The users can use the command: node liri.js movie-this 'movie name here' to call the movie function.
Then the movie function provides the following output information on the film: title, year, IMDB Rating,
Rotten Tomatoes Rating, plot, and actors. Node liri.js spotify-this-song 'song name' calls the spotifyThis
function which results in providing the following output information for that song: artist, song name,
a Spotify song preview link, and album. Node liri.js do-what-it-says, reads random.txt command and the doWhatItSays
function executes the command, depending if it is movie-this 'movie name' or spotify-this-song 'song name'.  
If no song or movie is inputted, the song is defaulted to 'The Sign' by Ace of Base while the movie is defaulted to
'Mr.Nobody'.

## To Get Started
